                <h2>Peyton Manning</h2>
                <p>Peyton Manning was a Quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts and Denver Broncos of the NFL, although I remember him more fondly as a member of the Colts. He was a legendary QB that lifted the Colts from being a afterthought to having one of the best decades in recent memory. Although he has not been a part of the Colts for 10 years now, his legacy and achievements will never be forgotten.</p>

                <h2>Marvin Harrison</h2>
                <p>Marvin Harrison was a receiver for the Indianapolis Colts, and Peyton Manning's partner-in-crime. He was known for his speed, work ethic, and leadership through example. He and Manning formed one of the greatest combos in NFL history, and Harrison has been recognized for his work with an enshrinement into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p>

                <h2>Robert Mathis</h2>
                <p>Robert Mathis was a teammate of Manning and Harrison's during the Colts golden years of the 2000s. While offense gets all the glory, defense wins championships, and Mathis was one of the best defensive players in the league during that decade. The Colts Super Bowl would not have been possible without him.</p>

                <h2>Andrew Luck</h2>
                <p>Andrew Luck was the successor to Peyton Manning and a player who many analysts, coaches, and executives thought would be one of the greatest players ever. There was much fanfare around his entrance into the league, and Luck is one of the few athletes who managed to live up to the expectations placed on a #1 overall draft selection.</p>

                <h2>Reggie Miller</h2>
                <p>Moving away from football for a second, Reggie Miller is my favorite basketball player ever. He is the best player in Indiana Pacers history and one of the most iconic players in NBA history. He was known for his three-point shot at a time when it wasn't as popular as it is now. His game and his infectious attitude won over many fans during his time.</p>

                <h2>Sachin Tendulkar</h2>
                <p>Moving away from American sports completely now, Sachin Tendulkar is my favorite cricket player ever. My Indian family is the reason I started watching cricket, but Sachin Tendulkar was why I kept watching. A man of small stature but not accomplishment, Tendulkar is acknowledged by most as one of, if not the greatest, cricket players ever.</p>
